In this project I create a airbnb clone by first building a command line interpreter(console).

Tge command interpreter will make managing objects easy. it would be able to:
-Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
-Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
-Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
-Update attributes of an object
-Destroy an object

To start it:
Type ./console.py

How to use it:
Type help to see list of possible commands in the CI
e.g
(hbnb) help

Just type a command and it will run
eg
(hbnb) quit
